# Agent Factory
My first attempt at making a wrapper around the open ai package to automatically create agents to achieve a task. The assistants define the agents necessary to complete the problem. Then they create function schemas necessary for each agent. Lastly they create the code for each function definition.

## OpenAIThreadHandler
At the end of this project I learned about the threads and rewrote my OpenAIHandler to OpenAIHandler to handle the threads. This lead to a bunch of new ideas and my other projects.
